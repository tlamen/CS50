       <hr>
       <div class="defaultDiv">
           <p class="defaultText" id="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;I always loved to play videogames throughout my life. Since early consoles like the playstation 2 in my childhood, to playing online with people from all arround the
           world with my computer. Games started to become more than a simple way of entertainment, but a form of art, and a mean to connect people: the ones who play it and the ones who
           develop it.</p>
       </div>
       <p></p>
       <div class="defaultDiv">
           <h2 class="subtitle" id="header1">So, am I going to create my own videogame?</h2>
           <p class="defaultText" id="text2">&nbsp;&nbsp;This answer doesn't depend only on me. Playing online games for some years from now, I ended up knowing many cool people, and we ended up
           creating and administrating a discord server with nearly one hundred members. Recently, we've been growing up together and developed similar interests in engineering, coding
           and game design, and after some discussion we thought about creating a game together someday. It's still a very superficial idea, I would need to take CS50's games track or take
           another course on game design, and many of them would need to learn more about programing. But if everyone gets involved in the idea, we might end up developing our own game!</p>
           <p class="defaultText" id="text3">&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, to give credit to my friends on the server who were interested in this idea (and also to include another mandatory html tag), I came
           up with this table describing each one's skills and formation.</p>
