            <p class="defaultText" id="text1">&nbsp;&nbsp;Music has a huge importance in my life, since its power to make us feel better during hard times, to integrate people together (I'd say
            it's a bit like the internet itself). Applications like spotify, shazam and iTunes explored this importance of music in our daily lifes and helped bringing music with easiness
            and security to million of people around the world, demonstrating the power of technology to potencialize music's effects.</p>

        <div class="defaultDiv">
            <h2 class="subtitle" id="header"> So what's my project on music?</h2>
            <p class="defaultText" id="text2">&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think this is my most unclear project idea on what to do. Since music's traditional proposals were already largely explored, I thoght I
            could come up with something that explores more subjective aspects of music, like the feelings while listening a song we love, how music can help people during therapy and
            how can music become something so passioate and relevant in our lifes. Maybe I'll develop some kind of social media where people can discuss these topics and share their personal
            experiences, but again, this is just a bare idea of how I could improve people's life using computer science and integrate it to music.</p>
