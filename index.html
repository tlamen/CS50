        <div class="defaultDiv" id="text1"> <p class="defaultText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, world! This is my first Webpage created for 2020 CS50's pset8 in the Web track. This simple homepage will
        show a brief biography about myself and present a few ideas I've been developing with this course's final project in mind.</p> </div>

        <h2 class="subtitle" id="header2">About myself:</h2>
        <p id="text2" class="defaultText">&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was a young kid I had contact with computers, technology and
        videogames. But it was only at the age of 16 that I grew interested in programing and computer science. I started taking some online courses but with no clear direction on
        what to learn and how to use my knowledge. I got the oportunity to visit some universities in the United States, and bought a book to learn to code with java. But the lack
        of time because of school and bad pacing of learning computer science from a book made me give up after some months. Only with the covid-19 crisis and the social distancing
        I found time to retake my studies about coding, and that's when I found the CS50's introduction to computer science, from the Harvard University. Now at my last year of high
        school, and universities' approval exams being postponed due to the pandemic crysis, I started learning a lot and having a much brighter perspective of computer science.

            <p id="text3" class="defaultText">&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, it took me a lot of time to really engage in computer science. But what's my next step going to be? Well. I
            have a few thoughts about how I want to present my final project of this course, so I decided to show them in this page! I present three initial ideas of possible projects
            I plan to develop. Those projects were all based on three of my greatest passions in life, so if you are interested in learning a bit more about any of those ideas, and about myself, just click the names in the navbar
            above. Hope you enjoy it!

            <p class="defaultText" id="text4">&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to say thank you to everyone who's been helping me in this journey. Thanks to my family, specially my mother, my father, my grandparents
            and my girlfriend, who've been supporting me taking this course since the beggining. Thanks to my friends from the Imortal Kings server, who are involved in the videogame project,
             and whose friendship is very meaningful to me. And finnaly, thank you to all my cs50 teachers. This course has been amazingly build and I wanted to take the opportunity of expressing
            myself in this webpage to thank you all!</p>
