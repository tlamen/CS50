==== CS50 final project 2020 ====
Start: August 22nd, 2020
Objective: create a web application about football tactics, making users able to create, edit, share, submit and download different tactics and team formations.
The project will consist in 4 steps:
    1. Create a homepage where all the information shall be displayed to the user
    2. Create an web application using javascript where users will be able to edit their tactics and save then in their own computer (website might be launched)
    3. Create a login system and an upload system with a database, so different users could share their tactics and download others tactics
    4. Start doing marketing and launching it as an official project.
    
As submiting it as a CS50 final project, the main goal is to at least have a good prototype at the second step, with few things yet to be implemented to finish this step.
I will be using a flask application for the website, simillar to the one used in the finance problem set
